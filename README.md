Resque is a background queue system, written in Ruby.

## Redux branch

This is just a spike where I'm testing out a re-write of Resque. It probably
won't see the light of day...

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'resque'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install resque

## Usage

If you can't figure this out, you shouldn't be using this branch. ;)

## Contributing

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request
